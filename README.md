# BoTest

Quality of conversational agents is important as users have high expectations. Consequently, poor interactions may lead to the user abandoning the system.
In this project, we propose a framework to test the quality of conversational agents.
Our solution transforms working input that the conversational agent accurately recognises to generate divergent input examples that introduce complexity and stress the agent. 
As the divergent inputs are based on known utterances for which we have the `normal' outputs, we can assess how robust the conversational agent is to variations in the input.

This project will be introduced in a poster presented at [ACM IUI 2018](http://iui.acm.org/2018/) titled "BoTest: a Framework to Test the Quality of Conversational Agents Using Divergent Input Examples".
